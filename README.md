# Normal distribution data analysis note book
This short notebook plots the bell curve of you 1D random variable data, assuming the data takes the form of a normal distribution such as measurement of a sensor, 
body weight of the population for a certain country, elo rating of chess players, etc. 

This notebook also computes the 95th, 90th, and 50th percentile of your 1D random 
variable and draws the position of the 95th and 90th percentile on the plot using a vertical line.
